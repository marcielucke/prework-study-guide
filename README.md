# Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description


This project was created to guide bootcamp students through the Prework content. It holds notes on various baseline topics in coding including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub. The project was beneficial in practicing coding skills, as well as creating a place to refer back to content learned. The webpage can be accessed at any point in bootcamp for a refresher on these four topics. The process of creating this page taught me the tools needed to access github, create a repository, link a local environment to a remote environment, use various tools that web developers use on the daily, and think in a growth mindset. It also enforced the idea that it is possible to understand complicated concepts with time and practice.

This webpage can be used as a guideline for new coders. It has information about the basics of using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub. When the console is opened on DevTools, the JavaScript implemented will choose at random a topic to study first. Enjoy!
